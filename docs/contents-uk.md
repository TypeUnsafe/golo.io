## What is Golo.IO?

:construction:

**Golo.IO** is a small bucolic conference around Golo, guided by a still undefined structure, but likely based on unconference, talks and workshops.

Of course, **any other language is welcome***, to the extent that the speaker is cool, tolerant and fun (that's the only COC rules, everything else will be handled on a case by case basis).

## Where?

:construction:

Smells like Auvergne spirit :heart:

## When?

:construction:

Rather a date with sunny and hot weather. (But you should try french version to see a spoonerism ;) )
